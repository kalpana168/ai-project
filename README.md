# AI Project

## Description
AI Project is a Solidity smart contract that logs user interactions with timestamps on the blockchain. It allows users to record their activity and retrieve interaction history in a decentralized manner.

## Smart Contract Address
`0x13c7A618440e86DEbFD8eE834Db02adB66e8E6a9`

## Features
- Logs interactions with a timestamp
- Stores user interactions securely on the blockchain
- Allows retrieval of total interactions and last interaction timestamp

## Usage
1. Call the `logInteraction` function to record an interaction.
2. Use `getInteractionCount` to retrieve the total number of logged interactions.
3. Use `getLastInteraction(address user)` to fetch the last recorded interaction timestamp of a specific user.
